<h1>Black Box Investigation</h1>
<h3> By Javon Sampson</h3>
</html>
</body>
<h2> Background</h2>
<p>In our media and technology class we are working with a black box called the mystery black box. The mystery black box is a black box that has a funnel on top. When you pour water inside of the funnel a different amount of water comes out. Our goals in the investigation are to find out why and how different amounts of water comes out.</p>
<h2> Claim</h2>
<p> There are tubes, buckets, and valves making different amounts of water come out.</p>
<h2> Evidence</h2>
<p> The mystery black box is a black box that can intake water but it can also output water but it's never the same as the input. Observation we made about the box was the sound inside the box; it sounded like the water was being poured. To try and figure out what was inside the box we planned to use food coloring to see if the same water we poured in is the same coming out. Another test we could use to find out why and how different amounts of water comes out of the box is using a thermal camera. Our model used containers, tubes, and  a valve to help prove our claim. We used the tubes for the water to flow to the containers and we made a hole so when the water fills up to a point it will go to a second container then through the valve. We tested our model by pouring water in the funnel which took it through the tubes then out the box. The data we collected showed that even though we used the same input water which was 400 we got a different amount of water that came out 675 for our first trial and 866 for our second.</p>

<h2> Reasoning</h2>
<p>Models are visual representations of ideas they can be used to show concepts. Models have many strengths. Some of those are being able to show your idea with a physical model and do tests. Limitations of models can be the size, for example a model of the world doesn't show its true size or mass. They are much more simple than what they actually represent. The evidence shows that my group's claim is close to what's inside the box. The reason for this is the data  even though we had the same input water for each trial we got different output water just like the mystery black box. The evidence shows just like the black box we had different output water even though the input stayed the same. Our group's model and the mystery black box had the same data which most likely concludes that our model shows what's inside the box. If the black box did not have tubes, valves,and  buckets it would have sponges. If this claim was true the test would show a time difference before the water comes out the box. The input and output being different could be because of the sponges since the spong can take in water then release it left over water can make the output change. This means that our claim has some flaws and could use some more work.</p>


<h2>Personal Reflection</h2>
<p> During the process of making our black box my contributions were making the buckets and helping with gluing. During the build I learned the importance of collaboration and without it in a group no work would get done. What went well in our project was everyone having a job and sticking to it so we could complete our project. What I enjoyed the most was testing our build to see if it worked. Next project to do better I think I could take more time to work on my build since, on the project I was rushing to get things done. </p>

<h2>3D Modeling, Animation, And Augmented Reality</h2>

<p>I created my 3d model by working on it in maya I extruded images and added colors and lights. I learned alot of new things by working in maya for example, I learned how to extruded objects. What I struggled with at first was remember when to use the new things I learned for different situations in my model. In my model I added animations ot show the water flowing in and out of the black box.</p>

<h2>21 Century Skills I Have Developed</h2>
<p> During the Black Box project I demonstrated problem solving skills when working with my group to build our model. While building our prototype we had many issues like water leaking thorugh our box. I solved this problem by using waterproof tape to cover the holes in the box. This solved the problem leading to no more leaking when we tested it again. The problem solving skills I have learned during this project will help me conquer new challenges with later problems.</p>
