  <h1> Q2 Screen-printing Project</h1>
  <p>By Javon Sampson</p>
</div>
<h1> Here is a presentation of my screen printing project!</h1>
<h2>Project Introduction</h2>
<p>In the second marking period we started a project on screen printing. In screen-printing you have to create a frame with a cut out design and pressing paint through a stencil to make your design. We made our design on a box, 2 papers, and a piece of fabric. In the process we could use 2 different colors but I chose blue only.</p>


<h2>Concept and Process</h2>
<p> My initial concept for my screen printing project was the current image. I wanted to use a hand gesture that I enjoyed for this project and just have fun. The inspiration came from the good luck hand sign I used because I wanted to spread positivity. I did have a few different ideas, however I just wanted to keep it easy and simple. To make this idea an actual thing, my teammates took pictures of me and I chose the best photo. Changing and figuring out which setting looks best for the photo was one of my favorite parts.</p>

<h2>Capturing and Adjusting The Photo</h2>
<p> To Achieve the depth of field I need the Aperture settings I will try is F2,8 so i can see the gesture but the background is blurred just a little. I will make the sensitivity to ISO 50 so I can lower the brightness. I will change the shutter speed to 1/500s. I took the photo at a medium to high height so I can capture my hand perfectly.</p>


<h2>Editing in photoshop</h2>
<p> I opened Photoshop and made the necessary adjustments to the image, gradually changing it over the course of the days I spent working on it. I took out the background using the AI selection tool so it's just my hand and then I shrunk the image. After using different tools I applied half tones and changed the color also I used the pen tool to add the finishing touches.</p>

<h2> Frame and Screen Process</h2>
<p> Once I finished, I began preparing my frames to be screen-print-ready. To start, I created a blueprint to determine the dimensions of the frame. After completing the blueprint, I began constructing it. We used long pieces of wood, marked and cut them to size, and then sanded the edges. Once we had the four pieces of the frame, we glued them together using wood glue and secured them with staples to keep everything in place. Next, we attached the cloth for the vinyl that would go onto the frame once it was fully assembled. Afterward, I printed out the vinyl design using a specialized application connected to a vinyl-cutting machine. Once the design was printed, I used various tools to remove specific sections of the print. I initially struggled with this step and made a mistake, which meant I had to start over. After correcting it, I ironed the vinyl print onto the frame and secured it with tape. With extra time on my hands, I helped my classmates complete their frames. Once that was done, I started painting and created my screen-print on a box 2 papers and a piece of fabric.</p>

<h2> Leadership and Skills Reflection</h2>
<p> I really enjoy the building of over frames since it was fun using different tools to complete it. I was mostly effective at building my frame since it was something that I enjoyed and I had the dimensions from photoshop. I demonstrated leadership during this project by helping my classmates and teammates.</p>

<h2> Challenges and Growth</h2>
<p>During this project I struggled with many things. Two of these things are time management and my stencil. While working on this project I felt like I didn't have enough time on different parts and was rushing causing me to make more mistakes. For example during the process of making my stencil I messed up and had to restart since I was rushing. In future projects I will use what I learned in screen printing and in photoshop to make more artworks. I am to grow from these projects by not making the same mistakes and to learn from them.</p>

<h2> 21 Century Skills I Have Developed</h2>

<p> In this project I conveyed Problem solving critical thinking. I encountered many problems while working for example time but in the end I managed to overcome these challenges. Another problem I faced during this project was cutting my dimensions for my frame. I had a hard time correctly getting a 45 degree angle when cutting. I conquered this challenge by asking for help from my peers and teacher.</p>
